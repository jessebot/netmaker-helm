A Helm chart to run Netmaker with High Availability on Kubernetes.

## Requirements

To run HA Netmaker on Kubernetes, your cluster must have the following:
- An Ingress Controller and valid TLS certificates 
	- This chart can currently generate ingress for:
		- Nginx Ingress + LetsEncrypt/Cert-Manager
		- Traefik Ingress + LetsEncrypt/Cert-Manager
	- to generate automatically, make sure one of the two is configured for your cluster
- Ability to set up DNS for Secure Web Sockets
	- Nginx Ingress supports Secure Web Sockets (WSS) by default. If you are not using Nginx Ingress, you must route external traffic from broker.domain to the MQTT service, and provide valid TLS certificates.
	- One option is to set up a Load Balancer which routes broker.domain:443 to the MQTT service on port 8883.
	- We do not provide guidance beyond this, and recommend using an Ingress Controller that supports websockets.

Furthermore, the chart will by default install and use the postgresql cluster from [bitnami Postgresql helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) as its datastore.

### Example Install

```bash
helm repo add netmaker https://gravitl.github.io/netmaker-helm/
helm install netmaker/netmaker --generate-name
```

For values, please see the [autogenerated docs](./charts/netmaker/README.md) or the check out the [`values.yaml`](./charts/netmaker/values.yaml) directly.

## Status

This is a fork of a fork of [gravitl/netmaker-helm](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker-helm). This is a bit more actively maintained than the gravitl repo (right now at time of writing in March 2024), and it moves a lot faster, and so it may be slightly unstable as we work out the kinks. Feel free to submit a PR/Issue if you want to add something or if something is broken.
